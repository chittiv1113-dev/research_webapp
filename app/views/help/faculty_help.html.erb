      <h2>Welcome, Faculty Member!</h2>
      <p>This guide explains how to create and manage your research projects on
        the portal.</p>

      <h2>Creating a New Project</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Ensure you are signed in with your university Google account.</li>
        <li>
          In the header at the top right of the page, click the
          <strong>"Create New Project"</strong>
          link.
          <%# <div class="screenshot-placeholder">[ Placeholder: Screenshot of the header showing 'Create New Project' link ]</div> %>
        </li>
        <li>
          You will be directed to the "Create New Research Project" form.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fill out the form fields accurately. Required fields are marked and
          must be completed:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Project Title:*</strong>
              A clear and concise title.</li>
            <li><strong>Description:*</strong>
              Detailed information about the research goals, tasks, and
              expected outcomes.</li>
            <li><strong>Number of Positions:*</strong>
              How many students you are looking for (must be 1 or more).</li>
            <li><strong>Areas of Research:*</strong>
              Keywords or phrases describing the research field(s).</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Availability:*</strong>
              Choose one option:
              <ul>
                <li><strong>One semester:</strong>
                  Select the specific semester (Spring, Summer, Fall) and
                  year.</li>
                <li><strong>Date range:</strong>
                  Select specific start and end dates using the date pickers.
                  The end date must be on or after the start date.</li>
                <li><strong>Anytime:</strong>
                  Use this for ongoing projects with no fixed end date (it sets
                  a very distant end date internally).</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Preferred Class (Optional):</strong>
              Any preferred classification (e.g., Junior, Senior).</li>
            <li><strong>Other Comments (Optional):</strong>
              Any additional relevant information.</li>
          </ul>
          <%# <div class="screenshot-placeholder">[ Placeholder: Screenshot of the New Project form ]</div> %>
        </li>
        <li>Review all the information you entered.</li>
        <li>Click the
          <strong>"Create Project"</strong>
          button at the bottom.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Upon successful creation, you will be redirected to the project's
        detail page, and a confirmation message will appear. The project will
        now be visible on the main projects list. An email notification will
        also be sent to all registered students about the new project.
      </p>

      <h2>Editing Your Projects</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Navigate to the main projects list page (`/projects`).</li>
        <li>Find the project you wish to edit.</li>
        <li>
          On the top-right corner of that project's card, you will see an
          <strong>"Edit"</strong>
          button. Click it. (Note: You will only see this button on projects
          associated with your faculty account).
          <%# <div class="screenshot-placeholder">[ Placeholder: Screenshot of the 'Edit' button on a project card ]</div> %>
        </li>
        <li>
          You will be taken to the "Edit Project" form, which looks similar to
          the creation form but pre-filled with the project's current details.
        </li>
        <li>Modify any fields as needed.</li>
        <li>Click the
          <strong>"Update Project"</strong>
          button at the bottom.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The project details will be updated, and you will be redirected back to
        the project's detail page with a confirmation message.
      </p>

      <h2>Deleting Your Projects</h2>
      <p>
        Currently, project deletion might be restricted to Admins. If you need
        a project removed, please contact a portal administrator. If a "Delete"
        button becomes available next to the "Edit" button on your project card
        in the future, clicking it will permanently remove the project after
        confirmation.
