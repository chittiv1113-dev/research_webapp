      <h2>Applying for a Project</h2>
      <p>
        Once you find a project you're interested in and are ready to apply:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Ensure you are signed in with your university Google account.</li>
        <li>Locate the project card for the desired project on the main projects
          page.</li>
        <li>
          At the bottom-right of the project card, you will find an
          <strong>"Apply for this Project"</strong>
          button. Click this button.
          <%# <div class="screenshot-placeholder">[ Placeholder: Screenshot of the 'Apply' button on a project card ]</div> %>
        </li>
        <li>
          You will be taken to the application form specific to that project.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fill out the application form completely. Fields marked with an
          asterisk (*) are required. The form typically asks for:
          <ul>
            <li>Your Name (Last, First)</li>
            <li>UIN</li>
            <li>Texas A&M Email (may be pre-filled)</li>
            <li>Reason for interest in the field</li>
            <li>Relevant personal projects, classes, or work experience (optional
              but recommended)</li>
            <li>GitHub Link (optional)</li>
          </ul>
          <%# <div class="screenshot-placeholder">[ Placeholder: Screenshot of the application form ]</div> %>
        </li>
        <li>Review your answers carefully.</li>
        <li>Click the
          <strong>"Submit Application"</strong>
          button at the bottom of the form.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        After submission, your application will be sent to the faculty
        member(s) associated with the project. You should see a confirmation
        message on the screen. You can cancel the application process at any
        time before submitting by clicking the "Cancel" button, which will take
        you back to the project details page.
      </p>
